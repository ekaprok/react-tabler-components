# Contributing

All help very much welcome, just let us know in the issue comments what you are going to work on so we don't end up duplicating work.

Try and keep to the same style/principles used in existing components, always stateless functional components when possible, use es6 add any new components/new options into the relevant demo and docs sections. Any recomendations/improvements to style, structure etc are also welcome.

The library is built using [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library) which itself uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the demo site.
